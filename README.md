The Legend of John Novak - A simple tile-based rogue-like inspired by Linley's Dungeon Crawl, and of course, John Novak. LoJN is built ontop of the Slick2D Java Graphics Library (http://www.slick2d.org/)

It's still mostly not working, you can walk around and stuff, and some of the maps it generates are pretty cool. Other than that it's not much of a game.
